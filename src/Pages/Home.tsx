      <p>Hello,</p>
      <p>
        Welcome to the Ruptela React Test. This test is designed to test your
        basic React, Redux and working with REST API skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        For your convenience this, App was bootstrapped using "Create React
        App", "Bulma" and "Redux". It also comes preinstalled with "React
        Router" and "Axios", but you can use library of your choice of HTTP
        client.
      </p>
      <p>
        This component is connected to redux. To test redux setup{' '}
        <button type="button" onClick={test}>
          click here
        </button>
        . You should see the message change here: {testText}.
      </p>
      <p>
        This React app imitates a website with articles or posts. On the left
        you have a menu to navigate between this page ("Home"), page that lists
        all the post ("Posts"), and the page that adds posts ("Add posts").
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, to complete this test you will require an API. You can start the
        API by running <code>yarn api</code> or <code>npm run api</code>. To use
        the api you will make a <code>GET</code> request to{' '}
        <code>http://localhost:3050/posts</code> to get all the posts and a{' '}
        <code>POST</code> request to the same URL to create a new post.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this website looks pretty, you don't have to pay attention to
        styling, and only focus on the acceptance criteria described below. So
        please don't use any UI libraries like "react-material".
